## Usage Data
This application allows a user to display a list of items from an imported spreadsheet and add new items to the list through a form and submit button. These items (burgers) will show up on the "Ready to Go!" section where they can then be "eaten". The "eaten" burgers will then be displayed on the "Already Eaten" section where they can then be removed completely by clicking "Trash". All the user selections will update the back-end database.
